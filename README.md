# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide rideshare data visualizations for Pyber in order to determine affordability and service to underserved neighborhoods.
 
 ## Results

The Dataframe that is illustrated shows us that the total number of rides from Urban areas is 13x greater than Rural areas and about 2.6x greater than the Suburban areas. Also the amount of drivers in Urban areas actually outnumbers the amount of rides that were taken for that time period. Urban areas also featured the cheaper rides, compared to the Suburban and Rural Areas.

This chart shows that amount of fares that was made during the time period between January and May. Urban cities received the most amount of money for that period of time, followed by Surburban areas and then Rural areas. This outcome is pretty normal considering the population density of Urban areas.

## Summary

In order to increase the amount of rides utilized in Suburban and Rural areas, I would suggest the following:

1. Offer incentives to drivers in Rural and Suburban areas. Since there is a surplus of drivers compared to the amount of rides that are available in the Urban area (2,405 drivers to 1,625 rides), I would offer some bonuses for drivers that take rides in Suburban and Rural areas.

2. The average of fare for Rural areas is also the most expensive out of the 3 areas. I would offer some weekend or special discounts to people that utilize that platform. If se can increase the demand for rides, we can eventually lower the price permanantly.
